## Introduction

TetFit offers a modular approach into the ever-growing marketplace for DIY fitness apps. 
With features such as extensive workout timeline customisation, body condition monitoring and exhaustive guides to a constantly updated catalogue of exercises, 
TetFit aims to deliver an easy-to-use, informative and robust workout experience to all fitness enthusiasts out there.

## App walkthrough
###### The app consists of four major activities of user interaction:
- The launch activity serves up the exercise catalogue from which the user may select desired number of repetitions of each exercise for the workout.
- Post rep-selection, the user is moved into an activity to modify the duration of each rep in the workout.
- Once durations are finalized, a workout countdown timer is launched for each exercise and relevant info to the workout is stored locally.
- A floating action button on the home activity opens into a body condition report for the user based on past workouts.
